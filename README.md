# React Native App Project

## Introduction

This project is a multi-screen application developed using React Native and TypeScript, using importnant concepts such as styling, navigation, state management, and parameter passing between screens.


## App Structure

The app has many main screens:
- **Home Screen**: The first thing you see. It's the main page.
- **Details Screen**: When the user clicks on a chair, he goes to chair details. This happens for every chair on the home page.
- **Settings Screen**: Lets you change the settings in the app.

## Making the App Look Nice

I used StyleSheet API in React Native to make the app look nice. I tried to make the design responsive on all devices using Dimensions, but this was hard, and I need to learn more about it.

## Moving Around in the App

To go from one screen to another, I used React Navigation. I also learned how to send information from one screen to another.

## Keeping Track of Information

I used hooks to manage information in the app, this means the app can remember what you do or choose. I also tried using the Context API to achieve a dark theme.

## Challenges

- **Design for All Phones**: Making the app responsive on many devices using Dimensions was hard. I tried my best to find solutions on the web, but didn't achieve the desired result. I need to master this in the future.

## Future Plans

- **Reusable Parts**: I want to make parts that I can use again to make my work easier.
- **Better Design for All Phones**: I need to get better at making the app look good no matter the phone size.

## Conclusion

Making this app was not that hard, but I learned a lot. I'm excited to keep improving it and adding new things. 
Thanks for reading about my project!
